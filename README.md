# Terraria Server CDK

This is a project for creating AWS resources to build up and run a Terraria server with CDK.

![Example](/images/terraria-frontend.png)

Example working server can be found here: https://tendermario.github.io/terraria-server-aws

## Technology

- GitHub pages
- Tailwind
- AWS cli
- AWS CDK
- AWS for infrastructure
- Docker
- Terraria docker image. I'm using https://hub.docker.com/r/ryshe/terraria/ here but https://hub.docker.com/r/beardedio/terraria looks fine too.

## Infrastructure

- API Gateway endpoint to start up, shut down, and get status of EC2 instance
- A lambda that runs those above three actions
- EC2
- VPC and Elastic IP
- CloudWatch Alarms to let you know the server is still running
- SNS Email topic
- S3

## Other features

- A frontend page to turn on/off your server
- Backup of the server files to S3 every 10 minutes
- Auto Terraria server start on server boot

## Prereq

- aws-cli installed on your system (`sudo apt install awscli` in ubuntu)
- node, npm
- aws-cdk globally `npm install -g aws-cdk`
- with your aws credentials set up with `aws configure` (ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
  - This sets up the files located in ~/.aws/config / credentials. If you get any of it wrong, you can change it there
  - Usually you should use the region closest to you
  - You should probably create a user in AWS IAM with enough privileges to create many resources... if you're lazy, you can set Admin privileges to a user and create the key pair under it.

## Setup

- Fork this repo

### Setup backend and CDK infrastructure

- Run `npm i` to install all the magic
- Copy `.env.example` to a new file in the same location named `.env` - edit the contents to your own details
- Optional: Update `bin/terraria-server-aws-stack.ts` with the names of the servers you want
- Optional: Add your world file as `world.wld` in s3-files, and update the `config.json` to have a server name and password if you want.
  - You can find your world file at: `%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds` on Windows
  - If you want it to have a custom world.wld name, you can update the variable in `terraria-server-aws-stack.ts`
  - All files in s3-files will be uploaded to S3, so if you want to put multiple worlds in there to be accessible from the server, feel free.
- Run `cdk synth` to create the CloudFormation templates - these are the blueprints for your infrastructure
- Run `cdk deploy` to put them into your account
- Check the status in the AWS console under CloudFormation. If anything messes up, you can delete it there and try again.
  - This should create the infrastructure mentioned above.
  - If you're changing the cdk, use `cdk diff` to see what the changes are
  - Note: if you change the EC2 server, it will terminate the old one and spin up a new one. Be sure you back up your world first if need be!
- The above deploy should have an "Outputs" section that has a url like: `TerrariaServerStack.TerrariaServerApiEndpoint8D383585 = https://ky331xbqw4.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/` Note this url.
- The outputs will also show the elastic IP that you will use to log into the Terraria server with

### Setup Frontend

- Set up GitHub pages so that you can find this page at yourusername.github.io/terraria-server-aws (or whatever your repo name is)
- Use the above url output and paste it in place of the varaiable of the first line in `index.js`. This updates the API Gateway endpoints to your own endpoints to call the server statuses.
- Feel free to play around with the styles to make it look better. It uses Tailwind for styles.

### Setup server

If you did not place a world file in the s3-files, you should have a server waiting to get logged into at your EC2 instance IP address, but you may also want to:

- Add a password and a ServerName to the config.json with `sudo vi ~/terraria/world/config.json`
## Useful CDK commands

Note: The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. This isn't set up very intelligently just yet and basically has the default values still.

 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region

Commands I never used, but will share anyway:

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests

## Setting up multiple servers

- Add another new TerrariaServerStack(app, '<Name>', {}) to bin/terraria-server-aws-stack.ts.
- Create a folder with index.js and index.html named server-<something>
- Use the different API gateway endpoint in the js file
- Create another folder in s3-files to reference if you want to load a specific world

## Todo

- Make the hard-coded endpoint in the JS file be added programatically when building out the cdk and setting up the API Gateway endpoint
- Maybe make a healthcheck

## Manual setup tips

You don't need to do any of this, but it is a rough reference for how to set things up manually on a server:

### Useful Docker commands

* `docker logs terraria -f` Get the terraria logs - I found that t3.micro was not enough and would crash when trying to load up. That's already a full gb of ram, but maybe that's not enough for a medium or large word. t3.small should be ok

### Set up terraria on an EC2 instance

#### Install docker:

Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html

```
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

#### Option 1 - Build the terraria server:

Ref: https://hub.docker.com/r/ryshe/terraria/

Enter the ec2 console and run:

```
docker run -d --rm --name="terraria" -p 7777:7777 -v $HOME/terraria/world:/root/.local/share/Terraria/Worlds ryshe/terraria:latest -world /root/.local/share/Terraria/Worlds/world.wld -autocreate 3 --log-opt max-size=200m -disable-commands
```

#### Option 2 - Move a world to the server and run it:

Enter the ec2 console and run:

```
mkdir -p $HOME/terraria/world

# Move the world file to ~/terraria/world and reference the .wld file in the below command... something like:
scp -i ~/.ssh/<yourpemfile>.pem "/mnt/c/Users/mvien/OneDrive/Documents/my games/Terraria/Worlds/world.wld" ec2-user@<your ec2 public ip>:~/terraria/world/

docker run --rm -d --name="terraria" -p 7777:7777 -v $HOME/terraria/world:/root/.local/share/Terraria/Worlds ryshe/terraria:latest -world /root/.local/share/Terraria/Worlds/world.wld --log-opt max-size=200m -disable-commands
```
